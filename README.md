# plog

Plog is a suite of some scripts to be run on a UNIX server for handling
Markdown formatted blogs, glogs, and email newsletters with Git.

An example of the generated output can be found at my personal
[blog]( http://yargo.andropov.org/blog ) and
[glog]( gopher://sdf.org/1/users/yargo ) sites.

Please note that most browsers are unfortunately incapable of displaying
[Gopher]( http://gopherproject.org ) links.

There is a fine
[Public Gopher Proxy]( http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/ )
on [Floodgap]( http://www.floodgap.com ) for those crippled browsers.
Therefore, if the direct gopher link above does not work,
you may try to access it
[via proxy]( http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?sdf.org/1/users/yargo ).
