# plog

*Please note: There is still missing a nice example of a working setup!*
*It will be added soon, to help in understanding the system.*

## Overview

Plog is a suite of some scripts to be run on a UNIX server for handling
Markdown formatted blogs, glogs, and email newsletters with Git.

An example of the generated output can be found at my personal
[blog]( http://yargo.andropov.org/blog/list.html ) and
[glog]( gopher://sdf.org/1/users/yargo ) sites.

This is describing version 1.2 of the suite.

### Notes about the Gopher protocol

Please note that _most browsers_ are unfortunately _incapable_ of displaying
[Gopher]( http://gopherproject.org ) links!

There is a fine
[Public Gopher Proxy]( http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/ )
on [Floodgap]( http://www.floodgap.com ) for those crippled browsers.
Therefore, if the direct gopher link above does not work,
you may try to access it
[via proxy]( http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?sdf.org/1/users/yargo ).

If you are using Seamonkey or Firefox, you may try the "OverbiteFF" add-on
for Gopher functionality. Overbite also is available for Android, via gopherproject.org or Floodgap.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

The plog suite mainly consists of the (sh/bash) shell scripts `pubnext.sh` and `allpub.sh`, and some configuration files and a suitable directory structure.

It makes use of the standard command line tools like `grep` and `sed` available on almost all Unix systems.

In addition, it needs `perl` (version 5.6) for Markdown-HTML conversion (and of course the corresponding script `mrkdwn.pl` included in the plog suite), and `lynx` for HTML-text conversion. _If there is sufficient interest, I may be motivated to enhance the scripts for graceful fallbacks to simple plain text processing -- just send me a note in that case!_

`git` is used to `git mv` the processed files to an archive directory; however, in case of failure, the scripts should gracefully switch to a simple `mv`.

The main scripts `pubnext.sh, mrkdwn.pl, allpub.sh` should
be installed in the same directory.

### Customisation of scripts

The two shell scripts have some variables set at the
beginning, which should be configured to your needs.

They can be used for processing several collections of
postings through the run-time argument of the working
directory (see below). In case you need different
configuration, you can simply copy the scripts and use
different instances for different collections.

#### `pubnext.sh`

Here is the (current) standard configuration at the beginning
of `pubnext.sh`:

    subpref='[newsletter]' # prefix for mail subject
    tpref='t' # prefix for text file names
    adds='ad.txt' # address list for recipients
    webdir='' # directory to save result from HTML conversion
    gopherdir='' # directory to save result from text conversion
    draft='DRAFT' # mark for draft texts (must be at beginning of one line)
    arch='Archiv' # archive directory for processed texts
    htmlhead='<HTML><BODY>'
    htmlfoot="</BODY><!-- generated by $myself --></HTML>"

- `subpref` is a string prepended to e-mail subjects,
  and could serve as a flag for the recipients
- `tpref` is a string with the beginning of filenames to be
  considered as texts to be processed (e.g 'text', 'post',
  whatever) -- but make sure it does not match other files
  in the working directory, like the archive directory,
  address files, or log and temporary files!
- `adds` is a string with the name of the address file of
  the e-mail recipients
- `webdir` is a directory where files resulting from the
  Markdown-HTML conversion are stored, i.e blog files
- `gopherdir` is the analogue, for text files (gopher)
- `draft` contains the string that should mark draft texts
  which are not (yet) to be published; it is used as a
  `grep` pattern, so be careful with punctuation
- `arch` denotes a directory (must be writable of course)
  where postings (input text/Markdown files) are moved,
  after being processed and published
- `htmlhead` defines the string prepended to the files
  resulting from Markdown-HTML conversion; according to your needs
- `htmlfoot` is the analogue for the ending of these files;
  also according to your needs or liking

*Please note:*

- arguments for `tpref`, `adds`, `webdir`,
  `gopherdir` may be given to `pubnext.sh`,
  overriding the settings in the script
- all directories are *relative to the
  working directory* given as first (and
  mandatory) argument

#### `allpub.sh`

Here is the (current) standard configuration at the beginning
of `allpub.sh`:

    # pattern to look for files that may be processed:
    prefix='t'
    # list of e-mail addresses:
    adds='ad.txt'
    # directory to save text files for publication:
    pubtext="$HOME/plog/pubtext"
    # number of text files to be included in the index:
    lentext=24
    # name of index file for text:
    indtext='gophermap'
    # directory to save HTML/blog files for publication:
    pubhtml="$HOME/plog/pubhtml"
    # number of HTML files to be included in the index:
    lenhtml=12
    # name of index file for HTML/blog:
    indhtml='list.html'
    # name of RSS file (to be saved in $pubhtml):
    rsshtml='rss.xml'
    # base name of HTML/blog directory (from outside):
    rsslink='http://www.example.com/blog'

- `prefix` is basically the same as `tpref` in `pubnext.sh`
- `adds`, see `pubnext.sh`
- `pubtext` is a directory, where pure text versions and an index file
  suitable for a gopher server will be saved; normally the same as for
  the variable `gopherdir` in `pubnext.sh`
- `lentext` is the maximum number of text version posts that will be indexed
- `indtext` is the name of the index file for pure text version; if you are
  planning to use it as gopher index, it probably should be called `gophermap`
- `pubhtml`, `lenhtml`, and `indhtml` are parameters analogous to their
  "text" counterparts, but for the HTML/blog version
  (`pubhtml` should normally be the same as `webdir` in `pubnext.sh`)
- `rsshtml` is the filename for an RSS feed, in most cases `rss.xml` is best
- `rsslink` is the basename of the blog directory as accessible from outside
  (i.e, not the possibly different name for accessing it from your shell)

*Please note:*

- a single argument can be given to `allpub.sh`, indicating the working
  directory where the source (Markdown formatted) files are stored; it will
  be passed on to `pubnext.sh`, and if empty, the current directory is used
- all directories are *relative to the working directory*

### Usage considerations

#### Directories

In any case, you need a directory (the "working directory"), where the
source texts (Markdown formatted) are stored. Typically, this would be
inside of a directory which is version controlled by Git, but plog should
still work without that. In this directory, all its subdirectories, and
additional directories needed for publication, the plog scripts (either
launched manually by you or by some automatic process like a cron job)
in principal need complete access permission (read, write, and execute).

As a subdirectory, you should set up the archive directory, and you have
to accordingly set the variable `arch` in `pubnext.sh`.

#### File names for "posts", or source texts

Next, you have to choose how to name your source files: they all need
a common prefix, so that plog knows what to look for. *Please make sure
not to use a prefix that would match any of the additional files or
directories residing in the working directory, or the scripts may crash or
even destroy necessary files or get into an infinite loop!* Good choices
might be simply `t`, or `text`, or `post`, or any letter combination
not including the address file; don't use any punctuation, except for
`-` or `_` after at least one letter.

Set this prefix as a pattern in the `pubnext.sh` variable `tpref`, and,
if you want to make use of `allpub.sh`, in its variable `prefix`.
(The file suffix is irrelevant: They will all be treated as text files.)

`pubnext.sh` will generate the list of all files matching the prefix
pattern, and then process the first file in that list which does
*not* bear the "draft pattern" as defined by its `draft` variable. If
you want to have your files processed in a certain order, you should
therefore name them in such a way that the lexical order of their names
corresponds to the desired processing order. An example would be naming
them as `pYYMMDDI`, where `YYMMDD` is indicating year, month, and day of
writing, with a possible additional index letter `I`, or `text_NNN.md`
with a numerical index `NNN`.

#### E-mail addresses

If you want to send an e-mail newsletter, you have to list the recipient
addresses in a file whose name needs to be set in the `adds` variables of
the scripts.

This file should be a simple text file with one recipient address per
line. Lines beginning with `#` are ignored and can be used for comments.
However, never use `#` after an address: it would be part of the latter!

If you do not need the newsletter functionality, you *still have to have
an address file!* It can be empty (or only contain comment lines),
but it *must be present and readable.*

#### Script execution

Both `allpub.sh` and `pubnext.sh` can of course be executed manually.
However, in most cases, it might be more useful to launch them automatically,
e.g from a daily or weekly cron job.

`pubnext.sh` processes just the next available (non-draft) post, and send it
in processed (HTML and pure text) form to all e-mail recipients, and save the
processed forms in the appropriate directories for later use (blog/glog
publication).

`allpub.sh` will call `pubnext.sh` repeatedly, until the latter cannot find
any available post, and then generate index files in HTML and pure text
version for publication as blog and glog.

#### Publication (blog/glog)

As it might not be desirable to publish the generated HTML and pure text
files (together with their respective index files) as the same user who
launched the plog scripts, a copying step for the final publication may
be necessary.

A possible solution is given in the script `plogsync.sh`. It simply uses
`rsync` to pull the files from a "remote" directory (which of course may
be on the same machine) to a "local" directory, and make all of them world
readable. Also a simple `cp` could of course be used, but `rsync` only
copies files which are not yet present in the target ("local") directory.

If you want to make use of `plogsync.sh`, please set its variables
according to your working and publication directories! You should
understand how `rsync` is working before doing so, though.
